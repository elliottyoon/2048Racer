        <h1>Why 4096?</h1>
      <p>The idea for this game originally came from the spring quarter of my freshman year of college, during which my friend and I got really into racing each other in 2048, sitting next to one another running the original game on each of our own laptops.</p>
        <p>After the quarter ended, I thought it'd be cool to create my own web app that would allow us to continue the 2048 racing tradition, even with thousands of miles between us. And so, with <b>2</b> (or more!) games of <b>2048</b> running simultaneously, <b>4096</b> was born! 
        </p>
        <p>- with love, Elliott</p>
